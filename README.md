# Enabling Signature Spoofing in Android 11
### First I want to thank Lanchon without whom none of this would have been possible. 
So, you want microG on Lineage 18.1. But wait, NanoDroid Patcher doesnt work! So what do you do? well obviously, you search on Google and find nothing except a badly written XDA Post.
I am here to help! I am just rewriting that post in a better format.
